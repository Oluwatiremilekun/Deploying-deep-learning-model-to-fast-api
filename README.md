# Deep Learning Model Deployment

Developed a hands-on tutorial on deploying a pre-trained YOLOv3 object detection model using FastAPI. 
This tutorial guides users through the process of creating a REST API for real-time image object detection. 
It covers essential steps like image pre-processing, model loading, prediction with bounding boxes, and server deployment using a user-friendly framework.
You will demonstrate proficiency in FastAPI, a popular web framework for building APIs. (e.g., hanedling file uploads, input validation, response formatting).
Strong understanding of deploying deep learning models for web applications. (This showcases your ability to put models into production).
